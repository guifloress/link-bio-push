## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#AF0C0C) to create a strong visual identity, as requested by the client's theme.
- Background color: Dark grayish red (#130909) to maintain a dark theme, in keeping with the original style.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#D44C0C), a closely analogous color for a warm highlight that fits the theme, but provides contrast for focus.
- Body and headline font: 'ClashDisplay', a sans-serif for a clean and modern aesthetic, per the design request.
- Use consistent and recognizable icons for links and social media, sourced as SVG files. Incorporate the FontAwesome library to include any remaining elements needed (like the share button).
- Maintain a clean, single-column layout optimized for mobile devices with a maximum width of 480px, as per the client's original design.
- Use subtle fade-in effects and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience. All existing effects like hover animations should be maintained and optimized.
